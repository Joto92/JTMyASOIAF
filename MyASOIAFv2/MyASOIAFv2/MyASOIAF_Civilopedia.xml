			<Text>When the First Men took up the old gods of the children of the forest, they created godswoods, groves within their castles and villages where a single weirwood, known as a "heart tree" and carved with a face, was planted so the gods could be worshipped. In the north every castle has a weirwood heart tree with a face. South of the Neck, however, most weirwoods were cut down or burnt years ago. There is a significant number on the Isle of Faces, however, and many southron castles still have weirwoods within their godswoods.</Text>

			<Text>Knighthood likely has its roots in Andal culture, due to its association to the Faith of the Seven which the Andals brought to Westeros during the Andal invasion, although legends of the Reach claim chivalry was brought by the First Knight, John the Oak. The host of a tourney decides whether only knights, or also sellswords, squires, and freeriders are allowed to compete. Especially in the Reach, the heart of the chivalric tradition in the Seven Kingdoms and the place where knighthood is most universally esteemed, is the most likely place to encounter a “knight’s only” tourney.</Text>

Redwyne galleys blockaded Storm's End during Robert's Rebellion. The smuggler Davos evaded the cordon, however, and delivered onions and salt fish to Stannis Baratheon and his starving garrison within the castle. During Greyjoy's Rebellion, warships from the Arbor served under Stannis when he smashed the Iron Fleet in the sea battle off Fair Isle.</Text>

Dornishmen claim the mounts are able to run for a day and night and another day, and never tire. In The Conquest of Dorne King Daeron I Targaryen remarked that the Dornish love their sand steeds equal to their children, and wrote that the Knight of Spottswood had his sand steeds stabled in his very own hall.</Text>

			<Text>The Greyjoys' main force is the Iron Fleet, they can also raise hundreds of ironborn ships. However, most of those will be longships made for raids rather than battle.  They can travel twice as swiftly as a merchant cog and can carry up to 100 men. The standard tactic for engaging is to board the enemy ship. The crew being combatants, as well as the ironborn preference for wearing armor despite the risk of drowning, gives the ironborn an advantage when boarding.</Text>

The City Watch was established under the Targaryen dynasty. Prince Daemon Targaryen once commanded the watch, from 104–105 AC. He was the one who instituted their uniform use of equipment, including the golden cloaks from which they get their name. The weapons he issued were dirk, short sword, and cudgel.

			<Text>The royal fleet is the navy which serves the king on the Iron Throne, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. The fleet is based in the crownlands at the capital city, King's Landing, and the island of Dragonstone.  It is one of the three most powerful fleets of Westeros, along with the Iron Fleet of the Iron Islands and the Redwyne fleet of the Arbor. War galleys or dromonds are larger than normal galleys and carry more tonnage as a result of being equipped with a ram, and they may equip siege weapons like ballista or catapults. They also have a larger compliment of oarsmen and soldiers onboard. The standard tactic for engaging is to ram the enemy ship, causing it to sink, or to board it if the attacking ship has a greater number of soldiers and wishes to capture the enemy ship intact. </Text>

The mazemakers were followed first by a race of hairy men similar to the Ibbenese, and then by the Andals, with each island having its own king. The largest of the islands even had four kings. In 1436 BC, Valyrian worshippers of the Blind God Boash travelled to Lorath and founded a temple on the main isle, settling in the ancient mazes of the first Lorathi, turning them into their towns, temples, and tombs. For three-quarters of a century, they dominated the islands. However, more and more people who did not share their faith travelled to Lorath and built villages. In time, the islands became a refuge for freedmen and escaped slaves, as the priests of Boash taught that every man was equal. Three of such fishing villages on the western part of the largest isle grew so populous and prosperous that they merged into a town. In time, the town became a city.</Text>

			<Text>The old gods are nameless deities of stream, forest, and stone worshiped in the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and beyond the Wall. They are so named because the Faith of the Seven (the "new gods") replaced them in all but the north of Westeros, where their religion is still practiced by northmen, crannogmen, and free folk. Westerosi of various faiths commonly swear by the old gods and the new. The old gods were originally worshiped by the children of the forest in most of Westeros in the Dawn Age, thousands of years before the arrival of the First Men from Essos via the Arm of Dorne. The First Men warred with the children and, believing that the greenseers of the children could see through the eyes of the weirwoods,  cut down the weirwoods where they found them.</Text>

Followers of the Faith in the north are rare and are generally not found on the Iron Islands, where the religions of the old gods of the First Men and of the Drowned God respectively are still strong. The gods of the Faith are sometimes known as the new gods to differentiate them from the old gods from the north. Members of the Faith worship the Seven Who Are One, a single deity with seven aspects or faces. For the less educated, however, this concept is often difficult to grasp, causing them to often believe that there are indeed seven different gods: The Father, The Mother, The Warrior, The Smith, The Maiden, The Crone and The Stranger.</Text>

The founder of the Faceless Men came to believe that all the diverse slave population of Valyria prayed for deliverance to the same god of death, just in different incarnations. Thus, in Qohor, the Many-Faced God is called the Black Goat; in Yi Ti, the Lion of Night and in the Faith of the Seven, the Stranger. The worshipers of the Many-Faced God believe that death is a merciful end to suffering. For a price, the Guild will grant the 'gift' of death to anyone in the world, considering the assassination a sacrament to their god. In the Guild's temple, those who seek an end to suffering may drink from a black cup which grants a painless death. As the Faceless Men forsake their identities for the service of the Many-Faced God, they only assassinate targets they have been hired to kill and may not choose who is worthy of the 'gift' by themselves. </Text>
